Arrays - store a sequence of related objects
    - each element has an index
    - storage allocated in a contiguous memory (side by side)
    - elements must be of the same type
    - can store basically any data type

- Can initialize array with values or initialize space for the array and populate with defaults

- Access or modify specific cell in O(1) (assuming u know the index)    
    - basically just pointer arithmetic

- If an array has capacity n, we can find any element in O(n) [linear search]

- Memory is Static for Arrays   
    - if we want to extend the capacity; or add even a single extra element outside the capacity, 
      we must copy over the data to a larger chunk of memory so that there is space to add what is needed
    - time complexity for adding a new element outside the capcity, is, hence, O(n)
        - u have to copy the whole array (O(n))
        - not very efficient in that regard
