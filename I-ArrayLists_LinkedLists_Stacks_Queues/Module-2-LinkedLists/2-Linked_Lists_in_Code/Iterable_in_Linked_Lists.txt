cannot access element at specific index in linked lists directly 
    - the reach/scope of a node is only to the next node 


u have to traverse the linked list w/ while loop until current node is not null 

for an iterator, overwrite the iterator method, returning new LLIterator<>();
- create the LLIterator class:
    - private Node<T> curr; 
    constructor = etting curr to head 
    hasNext returns if curr.next is not null 
    next returns the data in curr, then sets curr to curr.next

    note that for iterators u cant modify the list as ur iterating
