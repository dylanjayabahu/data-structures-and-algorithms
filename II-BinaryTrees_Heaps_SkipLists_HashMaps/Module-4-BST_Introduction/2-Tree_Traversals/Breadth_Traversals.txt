Levelorder Traversal 
    
    levelorder():
        make queue 
        add root to queue 

        while queue not empty:
            Node curr = dequeue()

            if curr is not null:
                enqueue(curr.left)
                enqueue(curr.right)

    looks at nodes based on depth order
        all nodes 0 away from root (the root itself)
        then all nodes 1 level away from root
        then all nodes 2 away and so on


    gives a unique representatin of BST
