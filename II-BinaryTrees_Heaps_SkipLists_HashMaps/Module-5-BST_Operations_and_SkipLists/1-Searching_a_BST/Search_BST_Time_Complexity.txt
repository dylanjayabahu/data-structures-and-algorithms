Best Case Analysis
- the root node is the value we are searching for 
- O(1)

^ best case analysis isnt rlly useful


Worst Case Analysis
- the tree is a degenerate tree
- O(n) 


Average Case Analysis
- not the average (mean) like with ammortizaion; the probabilitic average; expected performance 
- average out the performance in all cases of the BST structure => O(logn)


Note that logn is rlly good - it is significantly closer to O(1) than to O(n)
