Random Number Generator (RNG) - generates truly random numbers
Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) 
    - generates number in a deterministic way that appears random
    - based on a seed 
    - this is typically what is used when u call an RNG in many languages 


Usefullness of Randomness:
    - Many problems have simple/elegant random solutions with no deterministic counterpart 
        e.g testing primality; many random tests existed but hard to find deterministic one

    - it remains an open problem for whether or not randomness improves the power of computing 
        we have several problems for which it seems randomness is key to the solution, 
        but it could be that we just havent found the right deterministic solution
