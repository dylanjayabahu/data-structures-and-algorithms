Insertion Sort: another iterative sort algo
    - Assumes the elements before are sorted, and inserts this element among the previous sorted elements 


def insertionSort(array){

    for n = 1 up to array.length-1{
        set i to be behind the presorted array (i = n)

        while (i > 0 and array[i]<array[i-1]){
            swap i, i-1
            i--;
        }
    }

}


Insertion Sort Analysis:
    Best case: O(n)
    Average and worst case: O(n^2)
    Stable, adaptive (by design - no optimizations needed), and in place
