Selection sort 
    - another iterative sort algo 
    - searches and finds the max element in the array, then swaps it with last so its in right place
        ^ other implementations take min instead 

def SelectionSort(array){
    for n = arrayLength-1 to 1:
        maxIndex = 0
        for i from 0 to n:
            maxIndex = i if array[i] > array[maxIndex] else maxIndex

        swapIndexes(n, maxIndex)
}

Selection Sort Analysis:
    O(n^2) in best/worst/average case (no optimizations)
    Not Stable (blind swaps with last element; we move the last element no matter what and could be moving it out of og order for same-value objects)
    Not Adaptive (doesnt detect if array is sorted)
    In place
