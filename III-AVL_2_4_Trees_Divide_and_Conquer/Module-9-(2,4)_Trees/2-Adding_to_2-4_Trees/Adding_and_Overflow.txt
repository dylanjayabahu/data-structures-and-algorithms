We search 2-4 tree before adding just like with BSTs.
    - we add to the leafs as with BSTs. But instead of adding new children, we add to the leaf nodes themselves

    - If there are too many data in the node, we perform a promotion (split) to resolve it, which is propogated up the tree 



Add Algo:
    search the tree until u get to leaf node 

    once there, add the data to the node (its ok if it overflows rn)

    We choose to promote the 2nd or 3rd data value (depending on implementation)
        ^ only middle data can be promoted
    
    To promote, the middle element is moved up into its parent (again, ok if overlow, that will also be promoted up)
        ^ if no parents, the middle not is promoted up to the new root
    the overflowed node is split into 2 parts: data that was left of the promoted boi and data that was right of the promote boi
    Each of these is a new child node
