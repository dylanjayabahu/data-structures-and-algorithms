When adding we encountered overflow - there is more than 3 data in a node 
    - Handled with promotion 
When removing we encounter underflow - there is less than 1 data in a node  
    - Handled with transfer or fusion 

    Transfer: 
        -easier and preferred if possible

        
        Rn there is no data in this node. We need to fill it somehow 
        Check if immediate siblings have transferable data (e.g. it has multiple data, not just 1)
            If so:
                Move the parent down to the empty node 
                Move the transferable data up to the parent 
            If not, must go to fusion

    Fusion: 
        Rn there is no data in this node.
        If none of the immediate siblings have transferable data:   
            Bring down data from the parent node. (if many data in the parent, bring the data that is a bounadry to this interval)
            Now fuse the two nodes
        
        If we caused underflow with the parent, handle that with transfer if possible, then fusion again 
            ^ we can see that fusion could propogate the underflow up to the root
            if the underflow propgates to the root, once we have removed the root, the new fused node becomes the new root
