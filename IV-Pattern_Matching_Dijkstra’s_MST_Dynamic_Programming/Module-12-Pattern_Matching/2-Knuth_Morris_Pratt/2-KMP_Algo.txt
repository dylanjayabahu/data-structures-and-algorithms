Comparison of BM vs KMP 
    - Upon mismatch 
        BM queries for mismatched text character in last occurence table 
        KMP queries for patternIndex in failure table 
    
    - Comparsion order
        BM compares right to left 
        KMP compares left to right 

    - Realignment
        BM: causes mismatched character to now match
        KMP: causes all chars before mismatch to still match 


KMP algorithm 
    j is the pattern index 

    k is the text index 

    f is the failure table 


def KMP(pattern, t){
    m = pattern.length
    n = text.length

    f = failureTable(p)

    j = 0
    k = 0 

    while (k < n):
        if pattern[j] == text[k]: //continuing match; case 1
            if j == m-1:
                return k or add k to outputList //found case depending on single/all occurences 
                k += f[-1] //needed if we are finding all occurences
                j = f[j-1] //update j just as if we had found a mismatch in case 3; note that j=m, so f[j-1] = f[m-1] = f[-1]
                //essentially we are realligning directly to the longest prefix/suffix match right away 
            else:
                j++
                k++
            
    
        else: //mismatch case 
            if j == 0: //case 2
                k++ 
            else: //case 3
                //the text was aligned with the pattern up to j. 
                //so a suffix in the text is like a suffix in the pattern 
                //we want to realign the prefix in the pattern with a suffix in the text - which is exactly what the failure table lets us do
                j = f[j-1] 

}



Complexity analysis:
    Worst Case: O(m + n)
        O(m) to make failure table 
        O(n) to iterate through 
            ^ this is the same argument as why it is O(m) to make failure table. There are 2n comparisons at worst 
    
    Best Case O(m + n) //same 

    So KMP is Theta(m+n) for all occurences


    Best case of single occurence is O(m)


    Note that this asymptotic analysis is not necessarily representative of real world 
        BM will often perform better in english like text because it can skip large mismatches quickly; BM's worst case only comes up if very unlucky 
        KMP, although guaranteeing better worst case performance, isnt necessarily better 
        BM is the industry standard for this reason, of many other reasons
