Kruskal's Algorithm
    - finds the MST of a undirected, connected graph 
    - naturally discovers if graph is not connected and computes MSF instead
    

    Algo:
        - add every edge to a priorityQueue
        - while PQ nonEmpty and MST size not reached: //for v vertices, MST will have v-1 edges
            dequeue edge from PQ 
            if edge doesnt form cycle, add edge to MST 
        
    
    very simple and intuitive 


Cycle Property:
    Cycle property motivates Kruskals Algo just as Cut property motivates prims algo 

    If we look at heaviest edge of any cycle, that edge will not be included in the MST 
    
    In kruskal's algo, if we come to an edge that forms a cycle, it must be the heaviest 
        since all the lesser weighted ones have already been added 

We cannot use the visited set as with all the others 
    We arent starting with a source and working out - we are building clusters globally across the graph 

    As such we need a new way of storing - namely the disjoint set
