Knapsack Problem:  
    - np complete 
    - specifically looking at O-1Knapsack
        we are shoplifting a store 
        we want to maximize money made
        we have a large knapsack which can handle a total weight W 
        items have weights w1, w2, w3... that are integral 
        item wi has value vi 
        only 1 of each item (hence 0-1 version)

        what is max value obtainable?

Solution:
    n is num items 
    S = new matrix of W+1 x n+1

    S[i][j] = max value with max weight i using up to item j 


    S[i][0] = 0 for all i since with no items u cannot get any value 
    S[0][i] = 0 since for no weight u cannot get any value 


    S[i][j] = max(
        S[i-w[j]][j] + v[j], 
        S[i][j-1]
    )

    ^ we can compute this in the same way we did for LCS matrix in O(nW)

Although it seems we have just solved an NP-complete problem in polynomial time:
    However, the input W doesnt have W digits, but rather O(log(W)) digits 

    So really, the algo is actually exponential in W
        it is only polynomial in the value of W, not the actual input W 
    
    Such problems are called weakly Np-complete
