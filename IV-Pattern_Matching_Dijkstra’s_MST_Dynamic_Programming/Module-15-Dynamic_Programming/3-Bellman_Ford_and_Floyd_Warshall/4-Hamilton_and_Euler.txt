Hamiltonian Cycle:
    a cycle that passes through all nodes 

Euler Circuit:
    a circuit that passes through all nodes 



Cycle/Circuit Definition reminder:
    Path (simple path): a sequence of non-repeated adjacent vertices; a set of edges that connect two vertices
    Trail (non simple path): a sequence of (possibly repeated) adjacent vertices, but edges still cant repeat
    Cycle: a path where first and last vertices are adjacent
    Circuit: a trail where first and last vertices are adjacent 


Euler Circuit Problem is in P 
    if all vertices have an even degree and graph is connected, an Euler Circuit exists 
    can be checked in O(|V| + |E|)


Hamiltonian Cycle Problem is in NP, and is NP complete 



Another example is that shortest path problem is P, while longest path problem is NP-hard
