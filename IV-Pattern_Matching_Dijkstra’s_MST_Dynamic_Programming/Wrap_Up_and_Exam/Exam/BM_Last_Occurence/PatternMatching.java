     * Builds the last occurrence table that will be used to run the Boyer Moore algorithm.
     *
     * Note that each char x will have an entry at table.get(x).
     * Each entry should be the last index of x where x is a particular
     * character in your pattern.
     * If x is not in the pattern, then the table will not contain the key x,
     * and you will have to check for that in your Boyer Moore implementation.
     *
     * Ex. pattern = octocat
     *
     * table.get(o) = 3
     * table.get(c) = 4
     * table.get(t) = 6
     * table.get(a) = 5
     * table.get(everything else) = null, which you will interpret in
     * Boyer-Moore as -1
     *
     * If the pattern is empty, return an empty map.
     * You may assume that the passed in pattern will not be null.
     *
     * @param pattern A pattern you are building last table for.
     * @return A Map with keys of all of the characters in the pattern mapping
     *         to their last occurrence in the pattern.
